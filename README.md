# andi_challenge

Analysis of single particle tracking data for characterisation of anomalous diffusion, using a deep learning approach. 
Submitted to the [Anomalous Diffusion Challenge](http://www.andi-challenge.org/)

Performs three tasks on 1D and 2D tracks:
-	Task 1: inference of anomalous exponent
-	Task 2: classification of diffusion model
-	Task 3: segmentation of trajectories

The repository contains pre-trained models, and the code used to train these models.


### Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/tsmbland/andi_challenge.git
    cd andi_challenge
    
Create conda environment:

    conda create -n andi python=3.7
    conda activate andi

Install packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


### Generating datasets

Validation and test data can be generated by running Test/Generate.py and Validation/Generate.py respectively.
By default, this will generate 10,000 tracks per task per dimension (1D and 2D) for test and validation, using the andi-datasets package.

Training data is generated on-the-fly during training, and does not need to be generated beforehand.


### Training models

To train models, run the scripts in the Train folder for the respective task (E.g. Task1_Exponent/Train/1D.py for task 1 in 1D).
Pre-trained models included as .h5 files in the Models folder for each task.


### Analysing competition data

The repository includes three scripts for analysing competition data in the ‘Competition’ folder, named Task1.py, Task2.py and Task3.py for the three tasks. 
To perform analysis, run these scripts, specifying the path to the data folder at the top of the file.
